## I'm Kathleen Yi

Hi, I'm Kathy Yi, studying data science at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).

Previously, I was working in genetic sequencing at Bay Area companies and researching in neuroregeneration at the Institute of Pediatric Regenative Medicine. Now I'm a data science intern at PG&E where I am using cloud-computing to predict asset health. I'm interested in learning how various systems (data or biological) work and leveraging those pathways in real-world applications! Ask me more or check out my other projects.
