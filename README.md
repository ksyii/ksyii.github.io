Previously, I was working in genetic sequencing at Bay Area companies and researching in neuroregeneration at the Institute of Pediatric Regenative Medicine. Currently I'm a data science intern at PG&E where I am using cloud-computing to predict asset health. I'm interested in learning how various systems (data or biological) work and leveraging those pathways in real-world applications!
